SAM Exploration — Qualitative Notes
=====================================
Tool          : Ultralytics SAM (sam_b.pt)
Tested on     : 5 validation images (bus + truck)

What worked:
  - Clean pixel-level masks for large, well-separated vehicles.
  - Useful for visualising exact vehicle boundaries beyond bounding boxes.
  - Fast inference with the SAM base model.

What failed / limitations:
  - Heavily occluded vehicles: SAM merged two adjacent trucks into one mask.
  - Small distant vehicles: mask boundaries were imprecise.
  - SAM provides no class labels — requires YOLO detections as prompts.
  - Not used for training metrics; YOLOv8 bounding boxes are the primary output.

Conclusion:
  SAM is valuable for annotation quality checks and visualisation,
  but bounding-box detection is sufficient for the enforcement pipeline.
